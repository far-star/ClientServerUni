SHU Project - September 2024



Setup instructions:

First ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 and RabbitMQ installed.

Clone the repo to your Visual Studio.

Setup the RabbitMQ by following the instructions inside the Word document under this path: C:\<wherever you have saved your repo>\far-star\ClientServerUni\SmartMeter.Server.Core\Resources\Documentation

Next open the SmartMeter.Server.Core in one VS window, and SMClient in another VS window.

Then press 'Start' on the server and after a few seconds press 'Start' on the SMClient and it should run!

Please note that our video recording demo is in 2 parts.
